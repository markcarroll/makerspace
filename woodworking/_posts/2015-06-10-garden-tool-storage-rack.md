I needed some way to hang up all our garden tools so came up with this not very fancy, but quite useful garden tool storage rack that I built out of one piece of regular 2&#215;6 lumber.

First I marked up and drilled two holes near each other using a spade bit.

I repeated this all the way down the wood at regular intervals.

Next I got out my jigsaw and connected all the pairs of holes together along with creating an opening to the front.

This seemed to look reasonable so I repeated it along the whole length, making some of them slightly different sizes for different tools.

I then used a couple of off-cuts to use as mounting blocks and attached it to the wall.

Hey Presto! Not a very elegant rack but it did the job quickly and for far less than the ones in Home Depot.
