I built this Maple Dresser 20 years ago from raw maple but only took these pictures recently. I bought some raw maple
from someone at work that had them slabbed and stickered for a year so they were good and ready to start turning into
something beautiful. 

I designed the dresser myself on my laptop and then got to work prepping the raw wood. I jointed, planed, cut, glued and
assembled everything according to the plans.  Somewhere along the way I decided to fance the sides up with a router. I
put some detail on the side edges that I am particuarly proud of.

Then started the sanding, boy was there a lot of sanding.  I took the top
over to a furniture shop to run it through their massive drum sander to get it as level as possible.  Then to get it as
mirror smooth as it came out I went through multiple stages of wetting the surface and then sanding to 320 grit. Then
wetting it again and sanding it some more increasing the grit until it came out looking amazing. After that I didnt want
to cover it up with paint or a stain so I just used a simple clear coat to let the grain shine through. 

Here are the plans I made.
