### STL

This was a fantastically well designed speaker mount for my Sonos One speaker that I wanted to mount on the wall.  I installed an inset plug into the wall so that it could contain all the wires and the speaker would be flush with the wall.  This mount was perfect for that.  It has a small shelf that the speaker sits on and then a couple of pieces that extrude upwards into some holes in the speaker to produce a pretty firm mount.  It is a very snug fit and holds the speaker very well. I have not had any issues with it.
