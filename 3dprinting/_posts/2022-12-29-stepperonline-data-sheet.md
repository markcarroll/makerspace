## OMC/StepperOnline Nema 17 Stepper Motor Kit 17HS19-2004S1

Sold as "[VORON 2.4 & Afterburner 3D Printer Nema 17 Stepper Motor Kit 17HS19-2004S1](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/voron-afterburner-3d-printer-nema-17-stepper-motor-kit-17hs19-2004s1-17hs08-1004s-voron)"

Package includes:

- 1 x Nema 17 Bipolar 1.8deg 16Ncm (22.6oz.in) 1A 3.7V 42x42x20mm 4 Wires 17HS08-1004S
- 6 x Nema 17 Bipolar 59Ncm (84oz.in) 2A 42x48mm 4 Wires w/ 1m Cable & Connector 17HS19-2004S1

Since most people are probably upgrading to StealthBurner and CW2 the single 17HS08-1004S is not needed for that mod.

I bought these from West3D for $89.99+Tax, however I have since found that OMC/StepperOnline is selling them [direct on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3YUHBqZ) for a lot cheaper.
