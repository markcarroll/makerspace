### Instructions

All of these models, with the exception of the Pteradactyl, were print in place models that you simply print as is.
Once they are done, carefully detach them from the build place and wiggle the joints until they are loose.

The [pteradactyl prints in two halfs](pteradactyl.html) with one part sliding onto the other. 

Have fun with them. We have been.
