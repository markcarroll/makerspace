### STL

These are fun for halloween. They have hooks on the top to hang from a wind-chime type holder. We printed five skull chains and five finger bones. 

Here is the thingiverse link: <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4962956>

### Print Settings

|**Printer:**| Tronxy X5SA Pro |
|**Slicer:**| Cura|
|**Material:**| eSun PLA+ White|
|**Resolution:**| 0.2mm |
|**Nozzle:**| 0.4mm |
|**Wall Lines:**| 2 |
|**Rafts:**| Brim |
|**Supports:**| Yes, 60° |
|**Infill:**| 15% Cubic |

### Instructions

These were a little tricky due to their uneven nature.  What worked best was raising them 3mm off the build plate and then printing supports at 60° angles and then adding a brim to help stop them from falling over.

I printed two at a time so that if one failed I didnt lose too many at a time.
