### STL

One of many amongst the [articulated creature theme](/tags#Flexi-Creatures). This one prints in two parts and you slide the wings on to the body.  It is a little difficult to stand upright but it works.

### Instructions

This one was very simple as the creator had already added the support to the print. So print both pieces flat to the build plate and then once done, pull off the support and slide the wings onto the body.
