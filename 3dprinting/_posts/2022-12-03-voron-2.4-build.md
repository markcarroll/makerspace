# Build

This was my build list for the 300mm Voron 2.4 I built. I am planning on updating it to 2.4R2 and will list those components as I find them.

I ordered parts from Amazon, [West3D](https://west3d.com), [DigMach](https://store.digmach.com), [KB-3D](https://kb-3d.com/store/), Fabreeko, [Printed Solid](https://www.printedsolid.com) and [Mandala Rose Works](https://mandalaroseworks.com).

More recently I have seen parts and even kits appearing on Amazon. A lot of the parts are the same manufacturers as those from other suppliers, but with Amazon Prime shipping and potentially cheaper prices.  I had a lot of issues with components I originally sourced from West3D and DigiMach. They were both good at helping me fix the issues, but it took a long time to sort out which was not ideal. I also hit shipping issues with other suppliers that has pushed me to looking more at Amazon now than I did previously.

# Mods

## Afterburner PCB

I decided on Hartk1213's ["Voron Afterburner Toolhead Board v3.rabbit (also known as ERCF PCB board)"](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/Afterburner_Toolhead_PCB) since one day I may add a ERCF Filament changer.

You will also need a new PCB cover from [here](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/Afterburner_Toolhead_PCB/STLs/Clockwork/Covers)

Since the PCB has a temperature sensor built in, I ended up using [this cover with air vents](https://github.com/craxoor/VoronMods/blob/master/PCB%20Cover/STL/Afterburner-PCBCover-AirVents.stl)

## 2. Bed Wagos

I strongly recommend using Wago 221 wire connectors between the bed wires and the board underneath.  This makes it a lot easier to remove the bed whenever necessary.

I bought this [Wago kit](https://amzn.to/3VyjeNY) so that I would have plenty on hand, I now use them all over the place.

<https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/deepfriedheroin/v2_bed_wagos>

Use the bed Wago mount to make the bed wiring pluggable:

## 3. Nevermore Micro

Instead of the extractor filter and fan I am installing the [Nevermore Micro V5 Duo](https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro) mod.

## 4. Filament Latches for panels

https://github.com/richardjm/voron-parts/tree/main/voron-2.4/FilamentLatch

## 5. StealthBurner upgrade

Updated the tool head to the [Voron StealthBurner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner).

Parts kit: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3uljGTs)

I pulled the trigger a little early though so I have a pre-release build that I will need to reprint now that the final release is done. 

## 6. Klicky Probe

This has been the best mod so far. This mod replaces the original inductive probe with a contact switch. 
The best part is that, combined with some klipper macros, we can use this mod to do auto z-offset calibration, no matter which build plate you use. 

More on Klicky coming...
