The Ender 6 is a great printer in many aspects, but one thing it has always been troubled with is stringing. The original location of the Ender 6 extruder motor is half way down the right hand of the frame. This design means a very long Bowden tube that results in terrible stringing and the need for fairly extreme retractions that still leave a less than perfect print.

### Attempt #1 - Move the Extruder

#### Instructions

The way to reduce stringing is to shorten the Bowden tube.  Pushing and pulling a flexible filament through a flexile tube is never going to be as exact as we would like.  So shorterning the tube should lessen the negative effects.  The best way to do that without buying any new parts is to move the extuder closer to the hot end.  

As it happens the Ender 6 design has a perfect spot for the extruder that seems like it was almost made for this change.

1. First before you disassemble the printer you will need to print these three items:
   1. [Extruder motor spacer mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4750925/files)
   2. [Extruder filler cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4771539)
   3. [Extruder filament guide](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5031418)
2. First you need to remove the extruder from its exisiting location on the side of the printer.  Unplug the cable and, of course, remove any filament that is threaded through it.
3. Next, the black tube with the cables running through it from the hot end to the frame needs to be detached from the frame.  Don't move it far though, we are going to re-attach it close to where we took it off soon.
4. Now attach the extruder motor to the top frame bar at the back to the right of the z-axis mount. **Don't forget to add the spacer you printed earlier in #1**. For this you will a pair of M4 screws and M4 T-nuts.
5. Use one of the screw hole in the frame from where you removed the cable tube to attach the . Attach the motor mount through the spacer block with one of the M4 screws and t-nuts in the left-hand hole and one of the screws from the
