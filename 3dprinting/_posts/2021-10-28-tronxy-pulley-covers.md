This is a useful mod for the Tronxy X5SA Pro that doesn't cost any money (assuming you have a couple of screws on hand) and looks pretty sharp too. These covers protect the corner pulleys without requiring anything be moved or disassembled.

### Instructions

Each pulley cover prints in one part with tree supports from the baseplate.

You will need to print one of each (left and right covers) as well as two of the shims to go under the aluminum plate that the pulleys attach to where the end is hanging in the air (the end furthest from the front).

Just remove the one screw at the back, insert the shim and using the same screw, screw through the pulley cover, the aluminum plate and the shim into the frame.  Then get a M4 screw and attach the front inside hole to the frame with a t-nut. 

If you don't have spares, you can get screws and t-nuts from kits such as these:
